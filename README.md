Modular Analysis Functions
Each file type has dedicated functions for analysis:

APK (analyze_apk): Unpacks, decompiles DEX files, searches for patterns, extracts strings, creates hex dumps, and integrates with debuggers.
IPA (analyze_ipa): Unpacks, parses Info.plist, extracts binaries, and creates hex dumps.
Windows Executables (analyze_windows_executable): Static and dynamic analysis using GDB.
Linux Executables (analyze_linux_executable): Static and dynamic analysis using GDB.
macOS Executables (analyze_macos_executable): Static analysis using LLDB.
Golang Binaries (analyze_golang_binary): Extracts string literals.
Document Files (analyze_document): Extracts text from PDFs and DOCX files.
Archive Files (analyze_archive): Unpacks archives.
PCAP Files (analyze_pcap): Summarizes packet data using scapy.
PowerShell Scripts (analyze_powershell): Searches for suspicious patterns.
E-Mail Files (analyze_email): Extracts headers and body content.
Note: Some functions include placeholders where more sophisticated analysis can be implemented using specialized libraries or tools.

3. Pattern Searching and Reporting
search_patterns: Searches for defined regex patterns within the specified directory and file extensions.
display_results: Displays the pattern search results in a formatted table using rich.
generate_html_report: Generates a comprehensive HTML report summarizing the analysis results.
4. Debugger Integration
integrate_debugger: Launches appropriate debuggers (GDB for ELF/Windows PE files, LLDB for Mach-O binaries) based on the file extension.
5. Remediation Suggestions
remediation_suggestions: Provides actionable recommendations based on detected patterns to help mitigate identified vulnerabilities.
6. Main Functionality
Argument Parsing: Utilizes argparse to handle command-line arguments, including custom patterns.
File Type Dispatch: Determines the file type based on the extension and calls the corresponding analysis function.
Reporting: Generates logs and HTML reports upon completion.
Completion Notification: Informs the user upon successful completion of the analysis.
